To compute the energy requirements and the wind effect for the drone arcs, the reader is kindly suggested reading the paper. Furthermore, drone transportation times 
are computed as Euclidean distances divided by the drone ground speed. Finally, Truck transportation times are computed as Manhattan distances divided by truck speed,
all this plus the truck service time.
