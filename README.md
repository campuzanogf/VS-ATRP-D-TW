# The Variable-Speed Drone-Assisted Asymmetric Traveling Repairman Problem with Time Windows

A repository with instances for the ATRP-D-TW and VS-ATRP-D-TW

The ATRP-D-TW and VS-ATRP-D-TW are extensions of the Variable-Speed Drone-Assisted Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem, where a drone with different speed levels sits on top of a truck. The drone can either move with the truck, or fly somewhere. Therefore, these problems focus on studying the truck-and-drone delivery operations to serve a given set of customers, where asymmetric transportation times are intrinsically generated by the combination of features, such as wind effect, parcel weight, and variable drone speeds.

In the text files, comments within an instance's file start with /* and end with */ have to be ignored.
